# 🔨 My Projects

The projects presented here represent just a **small fraction of the many I've completed**, showcasing a broad spectrum of skills vital for Data Science. My passion for exploring new skills, technologies, and packages often leads me to engage in projects that might not make it to my portfolio or GitHub page, as they are personal explorations rather than formal contributions, and I prefer to focus on learning and discovery rather than extensive documentation.  
I realize that I don't yet have a comprehensive project to showcase my skills. I'm currently finishing a side project—a framework for creating simple deep learning models using logic gates instead of perceptrons—and will work on a more complete project soon.
