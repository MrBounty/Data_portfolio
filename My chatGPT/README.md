## My chatGPT - Using chatGPT to redo chatGPT

I created a graphical user interface (GUI) to interact with OpenAI's language model, GPT-3 and GPT-4. I used the Python PyQt5 library to create the GUI, and OpenAI's API to interact with the model. The program allows users to have multiple chat windows and switch between them. Each chat window sends messages to GPT and receives a response, which is then displayed in the chat window. The program also has features like renaming chat windows and deleting them. I also added styling to make the program look better. Overall, this program demonstrates the potential of GPT-3 to power chatbots and assist with natural language processing tasks.

**It took me around 4h to do it !**
